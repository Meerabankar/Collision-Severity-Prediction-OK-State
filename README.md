# Collision-Severity-Prediction-OK-State

Each year in Oklahoma state, there are about 76,000 car collisions. In these collisions, about 700 people are killed, and about 44,000 people are injured. Statistically speaking, that's roughly 1 in 100 collisions where a person is killed and roughly 1 in 2 collisions where a person is injured. Oklahoma state highway authorities are continuously working on to improve the state roadways by studying the possible reasons behind collisions in areas where maximum collisions are happening. The predictive model implemented predicts the collisions and collision severity in Oklahoma state based on various categories related to road condition, weather condition, driver condition, daytime, vehicle condition, etc. The real-time Oklahoma state collision data from the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) is used to train and test the model, it also contains weather data collected from Mesonet stations in Oklahoma. Model is built with different classification machine learning algorithms Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, and KNN classifier, the model is evaluated on F1-Score, ROC and it is 94% accurate in predicting the severity.

This model will help in reducing the collisions up to a great extent if used to get the collision and collision severity predictions in real-time.
